# the_salvager - 7DRL 2021

## Theme:
The salvager docks at shipwrecks or asteroid bases to salvage valuable technology or retrieve data.

## Preexisting things used:
The core engine is written with the help of the rust roguelike tutorial from http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook
Maybe a better tileset is added if the main mechanics are implemented

## Main mechanics:
The game difficuklty comes primarly from its lack of ressources for the life support systems
* Oxygen --> prime focus
* Stamina --> secondary
* Heat --> if I have time

## Opponents:
* Rogue machines AI --> main focus
* Infected crewmembers --> if I have time

### Nice to have:
* Powerconsumption system --> Ships have power cores which can be used for powering up life support, light, heating, internal sensors
* Different light levels
* Suit system --> The salvager is allways in a suite but at design start it will be implicit if there is time I want to add an suite upgrade system
* Radarlike minimap --> know what may be on the other side of a door
